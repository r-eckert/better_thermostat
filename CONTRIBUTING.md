## How Can I Contribute?

## New Adapter

If you want to add a new adapter, please create a new python file with the name of the adapter in the adapters folder. The file should contain all functions find in the generic.py. The if you adapter needs a special handling for one of the base functions, override it, if you can use generic functions, use them like:

```python
async def set_temperature(self, entity_id, temperature):
    """Set new target temperature."""
    return await generic_set_temperature(self, entity_id, temperature)
```
